# Arduino-Manipulation-with-Assembly

As a part of a really hands-on module Computer Systems, I have the delight of working with Arduinos, using assembly language to configure LEDs to represent information. 

- Looking at data direction ports
- Setting up delay using the clock cycles of each instructions
- Utilising subroutines and logical solutions to modern day problems

This repo has all the code, including the make file for running these programs, so if you do have an Arduino hooked up and any terminal window please do test it out!
